            <h4>7. HOW DOES Lazada PROTECT AND RETAIN CUSTOMER INFORMATION?</h4>
            <p><b>7.1</b> We implement a variety of security measures and strive to ensure the security of your personal data on our systems. User personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. However, there can inevitably be no guarantee of absolute security.

            <br><br><b>7.2</b> We will retain personal data in accordance with the Privacy Laws and/or other applicable laws. That is, we will destroy or anonymize your personal data when we have reasonably determined that (i) the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by the retention of such personal data; (ii) retention is no longer necessary for any legal or business purposes; and (iii) no other legitimate interests warrant further retention of such personal data. If you cease using the Platform, or your permission to use the Platform and/or the Services is terminated or withdrawn, we may continue storing, using and/or disclosing your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our obligations under the Privacy Laws. Subject to applicable law, we may securely dispose of your personal data without prior notice to you.</p>
            <h4>8. DOES Lazada DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS FROM ITS VISITORS TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?</h4>
            <p>b8.1></b> In conducting our business, we will/may need to use, process, disclose and/or transfer your personal data to our third party service providers, agents and/or our affiliates or related corporations, and/or other third parties, which may be located in Singapore or outside of Singapore, for one or more of the above-stated Purposes. Such third party service providers, agents and/or affiliates or related corporations and/or other third parties would be processing your personal data either on our behalf or otherwise, for one or more of the above-stated Purposes. We endeavour to ensure that the third parties and our affiliates keep your personal data secure from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, processing or similar risks and retain your personal data only for as long as your personal data is needed for the above-mentioned Purposes. Such third parties include, without limitation:

our subsidiaries, affiliates and related corporations;
buyers or sellers you have transacted with or interacted with on the Platform or in connection with your use of the Services for the above-stated Purposes;
other users of our Platform for one or more of the above-stated Purposes;
contractors, agents, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business. These include but are not limited to those parties which provide administrative or other services to us such as mailing houses, logistics service providers, financial services providers, advertising and marketing partners, telecommunication companies, information technology companies, and data centres;
governmental or regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over Lazada or as otherwise permitted under Section 6.2;
a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Lazada’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal data held by Lazada about our Service Users is among the assets transferred; or to a counterparty in a business asset transaction that Lazada or any of its affiliates or related corporations is involved in; and
third parties to whom disclosure by us is for one or more of the Purposes and such third parties would in turn be collecting and processing your personal data for one or more of the Purposes.

<br><br><b>8.3</b> For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Privacy Laws or other applicable laws permit an organisation such as us to collect, use or disclose your personal data without your consent, such permission granted by the laws shall continue to apply. Consistent with the foregoing and subject to applicable law, we may use your personal data for recognized legal grounds including to comply with our legal obligations, to perform our contract with you, to achieve a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights, or where necessary in connection with a legal claim.

<br><br><b>8.4</b> Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access personal data transmitted to or contained on the site, technologies may malfunction or not work as anticipated, or someone might access, abuse or misuse information through no fault of ours. We will nevertheless deploy reasonable security arrangements to protect your personal data as required by the Privacy Laws; however there can inevitably be no guarantee of absolute security such as but not limited to when unauthorised disclosure arises from malicious and sophisticated hacking by malcontents through no fault of ours.

<br><br><b>8.7</b> Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, Sellers (including any employees, agents, representatives, or any other person acting for such User or on such User's behalf) shall comply with all applicable Privacy Laws and, in respect of any buyer’s personal data received from Lazada, (i) are not permitted to use such buyer’s personal data except as reasonably necessary to respond to buyers’ enquiries and to carry out respond to, process, deal with or complete a transaction without the buyers’ and Lazada’s prior written consent; (ii) should refrain from contacting buyers using such information outside of the Lazada platform; (iii) are not permitted to disclose such buyer’s personal data to any unauthorized third parties without the buyer’s and Lazada’s prior written consent; (iv) shall employ sufficient security measures to protect each Lazada user’s personal data in their possession, retain such data only for as long as necessary for the purposes above and in accordance with the Privacy Laws, and to delete or return such data to Lazada upon any request from Lazada or as soon as reasonably possible upon completion of the transaction; and (v) to inform Lazada’s Personal Data Protection Officer at dpo.sg@Lazada.com in the event of any potential data breach or other loss of such user’s data.

            <br><br><b>10.2</b> We, and third parties, may from time to time make software applications downloads available for your use via the Platform or through the Services. These applications may separately access, and allow a third party to view, your identifiable information, such as your name, your user ID, your device’s IP Address or other information such as any cookies that you may previously have installed or that were installed for you by a third party software application or website. Additionally, these applications may ask you to provide additional information directly to third parties.

            <h4>11. DISCLAIMER REGARDING SECURITY AND THIRD PARTY SITES</h4>
            <p><b>11.1</b> WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE ON THIRD PARTY SITES.

Even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our Platform) may not be received by us.
